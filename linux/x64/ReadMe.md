## Compile Linux (64 bits)

First you get the builder project.

	git clone https://gitlab.ludoruisch.nl/root/DigitalNote-Builder.git
	cd DigitalNote-Builder

Then download all the libraries packages.

	./download.sh

When thats executed you will have a folder called "download" with all the libraries.

Once thats done we can install the latest apt-get packages.

	cd linux/x64
	./update.sh

Now we have all the libraries we need the Digitalnote project

	git clone https://github.com/IamLupo/DigitalNote-2.git

Now we have everything we can compile the libraries.

	./compile_libs.sh "-j 4"

This will take a while to compile like take a coffe while this runs.

Once finished we can compile the project.

	./compile_daemon.sh  "-j 4"
	./compile_app.sh  "-j 4"

And thats it! :D

PS: When everything is done there is a temp folder. This can be removed.
